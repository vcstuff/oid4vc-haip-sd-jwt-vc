It is especially beneficial if the credential has both the x.509 cert chain and support for web based key resolution, since the verifier can choose what data to use for validation. \r\n\r\nIf the credential only has x.509, it doesn't matter in the end what identifier we use as long as the leaf cert binds that identifier to the public key of the issuer. So using the HTTPS URL doesn't hurt at least and might be inline with the way domain validated certs (and cWACs? @paulbastian) work. \r\n\r\nEven HTTPS URL with paths should work. I checked https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6 and did not find an indication that this would not be possible. I mention it because as far as I remember someone stated that a SNA would only contain a URL with FQN but no path. \r\n\r\n> Isn\u2019t that pretty limiting?\r\nIn my opinion, the issuer can freely choose the URL so it should not become a limitation.
