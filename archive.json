It is especially beneficial if the credential has both the x.509 cert chain and support for web based key resolution, since the verifier can choose what data to use for validation. \r\n\r\nIf the credential only has x.509, it doesn't matter in the end what identifier we use as long as the leaf cert binds that identifier to the public key of the issuer. So using the HTTPS URL doesn't hurt at least and might be inline with the way domain validated certs (and cWACs? @paulbastian) work. \r\n\r\nEven HTTPS URL with paths should work. I checked https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6 and did not find an indication that this would not be possible. I mention it because as far as I remember someone stated that a SNA would only contain a URL with FQN but no path. \r\n\r\n> Isn\u2019t that pretty limiting?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the issuer can freely choose the URL so it should not become a limitation.

So we need to make sure we provide interop while having an broad enough scope for adoption. So we are not only looking for eIDAS ARF, we are also, for example, looking for small business intending to get something out onto the streets this year. In their deployments, trust might be as simple as the wallets and verifiers having a list of issuers (as a list of URLs). eIDAS ARF will certainly use other mechanisms, other deployments around the globe will perhaps use other mechanisms, too. It's their responsibility, to add their mechanism to our (global) interop profile. Modularity is the key here. \r\nFor eIDAS ARF, I assume the ARF/rule books will add whatever is necessary.

The Interoperability profile will defines the concrete mechanisms to be used to achieve interoperability in the context of the profile. \r\n\r\nCurrent idea is to support the same mechanisms currently used for SD-JWT VCs, web based key lookup and x.509 certificates. We  could add one section with key resolution mechanisms and state where those are used. ",

          "body": "> needs discussion. might not be needed because there is wallet attestation, wallet/client is not really a public client\r\n\r\nPKCE is not only needed for public clients since an authorization code can be replayed with different \"instances\" of the same confidential client. The key point is whether every instance is identified and authenticated separately, in which case the code would be bound to that instance. I would not assume that wallet attestation allows the AS to identify a certain wallet/client instance, that seems a to strong assumption to me. ",
